# Education: Python

Projects meant to learn more about python. 

# Topics

 - Async: Working with multiple threads and having functions return results as needed without blocking other functions from running
 - Simple Flask Webpage: Creating a web app using flask to run python code

# Dev-Container

This code will be run in a development container for python to help keep the development environment consistent and allow for the different modules needed isolated.
