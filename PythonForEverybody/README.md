# Major Goal of Book

The book is similar to *"Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"* but it more focused on data compared to algorithms and abstractions.  Since there is more focus on data science, there is still more that can be learned from the *"Think Python"* book if more knowledge is wanted. 

My goal is to reinforce some of the fundamentals that I skipped when I dove into the deep end at work getting a large (12,000 lines) program running.  I learned a lot during that process, but I've found that some fundamentals have been missed and I've relied on searching for how to do things instead of knowing how to do them.  

# Notes

## Chapter 1: Why should you learn to write programs?

This chapter is mostly about what programming is and the introductory basics of how the santax works.  There are bits about how to install python and how to run "Hello World" as well as how to quit the terminal interperator.
