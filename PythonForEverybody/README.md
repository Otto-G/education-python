# Major Goal of Book

The book is similar to *"Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"* but it more focused on data compared to algorithms and abstractions.  Since there is more focus on data science, there is still more that can be learned from the *"Think Python"* book if more knowledge is wanted.
